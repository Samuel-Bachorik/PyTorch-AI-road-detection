# PyTorch-AI-road-detection
Artificial intelligence, model, training loop, model loader, inference

AI model trained on custom dataset (1000 photos). <br/>
Learning rate = 0.0001<br/>
Optimizer = Adam<br/>
Results example from video.<br/>
Results could be better but due to low memory ofGPU this is Maximum quality.
